# Covid19-Data-Visualization-using-Python:  Visualize the global spread of COVID-19 using Python, Plotly, and a real data set.

Aim of the Project:
The main goal of this project is to use real-world data to perform data analysis and data visualization.

What we learn:
This project helps us to collect, analyze, clean, manipulate and visualize data with python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.

What we do:
We use 3 different covid-19 datasets and perform data analysis Using python and Tableau.

In this project, we used two datasets
One is "covid_19_india" data set for different states and union territories and the second dataset "Covid_vaccine_statewise" is used for analyzing the status of vaccination in different states in India using python.

We use tableau software to create interesting visualizations for dataset â€“ "country_wise_latest" and we will convert those visuals and put it in the form of a dashboard towards the end of the project.
